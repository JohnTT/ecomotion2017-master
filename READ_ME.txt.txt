This will be the folder containing most/all of the libaries and other shared components for the PCBs.

IN ADDITION TO THIS REPO (for ecoMotion created PCB libaries files), other libaries that will be useful are:
- Celestial Altium Library : https://github.com/issus/altium-library (??? I can't get this one to work - Kim)
- Butterwick's Altium Library : https://github.com/butterwick/AltiumLibrary


For example my (Kim Laberinto) folder structure is the follow:

ecoMotion PCBs Main Folder
- (Other folderS)
- PCB Libraries
-- AltiumLibrary-Master (from Butterwick)
-- altium-library-master (from issus) (??? I can't get this one to work - Kim)
-- master (ecoMotion's repo for created PCB files)
